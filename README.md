# FoodxHum (INCOMPLETE)

Idea is to create a way of quick small payments for food lovers who choose to go for online transactions rather the Cash or Card payment, As from my personal expriences easypaisa and other banking app they are quite slow and takes time to initiate themselves at first this for my is a bummer.

## Waht will be the application

The application will be mix of two parts one shall market you all the restaraunts near your location and the other one will be our payment application where you as a user can integrate you wallets in this way we will free ourselves with any instant access to ones personal account details, the goal is not to make the process of transaction fast since the compliance checks are necessary for all users this is something we have no control over but to make sure user will have a fast and agile interface to perform low amount of transactions

## How much achieved
To be honest not much as this idea is at it's inception but the there are some processes that are developed from the backend:
-- login/signup process
-- OAuth2 authentication
-- a dataset that is stored in Aiven mysql of restaraunts in different areas of karachi
-- to accurately match the entred user's location with restaraunts location on the basis of longitude and latitude so the templates are ordered from the nearest to the furthest from user's entered location
-- Users shall see the For you option where he will get his/hers preferences entered at the time of registration
