# FoodxHum (INCOMPLETE)

The idea is to create a way for quick, small payments for food lovers who prefer online transactions over cash or card payments.  
From my personal experience, apps like Easypaisa and other banking apps are often slow to launch and initialize — which is a bummer.

## What Will Be the Application?

The application will have **two main parts**:
1. **Restaurant Marketplace:**  
   It will list all the restaurants near the user's location.
2. **Payment Application:**  
   Users can integrate their digital wallets, allowing instant transactions without exposing personal account details.  

The goal is **not** to bypass compliance checks (as they are necessary), but to provide a **fast and agile interface** for performing small transactions.

## Current Progress

To be honest, not much progress has been made yet as this idea is still in its **inception stage**. However, some backend processes are already developed:

- **Login/Signup Process**
- **OAuth2 Authentication**
- **A dataset stored in Aiven MySQL** containing restaurants in various areas of Karachi.
- **Location Matching:**  
  Matches the user’s entered location with restaurant locations using **longitude and latitude**, displaying templates from nearest to farthest.
- **Personalized Recommendations:**  
  A "For You" section where users see personalized recommendations based on preferences entered during registration.

## Next Steps
- Develop the payment interface.
- Integrate multiple digital wallets.
- Improve the restaurant recommendation algorithm.
- Build a user-friendly mobile/desktop interface.

## Status
**Work in progress.** Contributions and ideas are welcome!
